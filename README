Iomega JAZ/ZIP Tool for Linux


Usage:  jaztool <dev> <command>

where <dev> must be the full name of a scsi device, eg: /dev/sdc, note
that you must not specify a partition on the device.  <command> can
be one of:

	eject	ejects the disk in the drive
	ro	puts the disk into read-only mode, and ejects
	rw      puts the disk into read-write mode, and ejects  
	status  prints the read/write status of the disk

If the disk is in a password protected mode, you will be prompted for
a password when you attempt to change the mode.  This version of 
jaztool does not officially support putting the disk into the password
protected read-only mode, but the command 'PWRO' will do this if you
are really sure that you want to.  REMEMBER: if you forget the password,
you will not be able to put the disk back into read-write mode.

NOTE: The JAZ/ZIP drives also support a protection mode 5 'PWNR',
under which the disk is neither readable nor writable until it is
unlocked with a password.  This program could not previously unlock
a JAZ disk in mode 5 - as Linux 2.x is unable to open a disk that
is not readable.  To support this feature would require patching
the Linux kernel.  (And therefore, there is no command to put a
disk into this mode, either.) However, as of 2019, and Linux 4.x
USB ZIP drives are able to be unlocked from mode 5 using this
program.
  
Whenever you change the write-protection mode, jaztool ejects the
disk.  This is done to ensure that Linux will recheck the mode
before it attempts to use the disk again. There is a switch -n if
you prefer not to eject the disk after the operation. *
