Iomega Jaz Tool for Linux


Usage:  jaztool <dev> <command>

where <dev> must be the full name of a scsi device, eg: /dev/sdc, note
that you must not specify a partition on the device.  <command> can
be one of:

	eject	ejects the disk in the drive
	ro	puts the disk into read-only mode, and ejects
	rw      puts the disk into read-write mode, and ejects  
	status  prints the read/write status of the disk

If the disk is in a password protected mode, you will be prompted for
a password when you attempt to change the mode.  This version of 
jaztool does not officially support putting the disk into the password
protected read-only mode, but the command 'PWRO' will do this if you
are really sure that you want to.  REMEMBER: if you forget the password,
you will not be able to put the disk back into read-write mode.

NOTE:  The JAZ drive also supports a protection mode 5, under which the
disk is neither readable nor writable until it is unlocked with a
password.  This program cannot unlock a disk in mode 5 - as Linux is
unable to open a disk that is not readable.  To support this feature
would require patching the Linux kernel.  (And therefore, there is no
command to put a disk into this mode, either.)
  
Whenever you change the write-protection mode, jaztool ejects the disk.
This is done to ensure that Linux will recheck the mode before it attempts
to use the disk again.

This distribtion includes a binary version (jaztool) compiled with 
gcc 2.7.2 on the Linux 2.0.7 kernel
